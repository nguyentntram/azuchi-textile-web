## 💡 INSPIRATION
Azuchi Textile Web was born out of a personal need — to support my family’s textile business in Vietnam.
As a Computer Science student, I wanted to apply what I learned to solve a real problem: help our small business build an online presence that looks professional, runs smoothly, and is easy to manage without technical knowledge.
Through this project, I also aimed to sharpen my full-stack development skills by working with technologies like MongoDB, Cloudinary, and deployment on Vercel.
